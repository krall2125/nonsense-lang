# A language of nonsenses (why would you use it?)
nonsense-lang (other names invented by therealten95 are "Sigma DC" and "Sigmasenselang") is a stack based programming language which can either be interpreted or compiled. There are some differences between the compilation and interpretation mainly the memory allocation being entirely gone in the compiled version, instead just pushing a pointer to the beginning of memory. It doesn't entirely work yet (everything works, but the putn instruction doesn't) and the assembly isn't the fastest possible. Mainly because I don't want to have an aneurysm trying to use the assembly that C generates to be the fastest thing ever.
